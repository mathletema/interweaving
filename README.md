Program that converts pixel art into interweaved design. A friend of mine taught me how to create hand drawn woven rectangles in 6th grade. I soon made changes to the technique so I could make letters. The process felt mechanical and tedious, so I made a program for it! See a live demo [Here] (https://mathletema.github.io/interweaving).
